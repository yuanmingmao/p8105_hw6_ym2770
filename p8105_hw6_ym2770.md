## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read.csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ 1
    )
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
    city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>% 
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
```

Start with one city

``` r
baltimore_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, 
    data = baltimore_df,
    family = binomial()) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(term, OR, starts_with("CI")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term              |    OR | CI\_lower | CI\_upper |
| :---------------- | ----: | --------: | --------: |
| (Intercept)       | 1.363 |     0.975 |     1.907 |
| victim\_age       | 0.993 |     0.987 |     1.000 |
| victim\_raceWhite | 2.320 |     1.648 |     3.268 |
| victim\_sexMale   | 0.426 |     0.325 |     0.558 |

Try this across cities.

``` r
model_results_df = 
  homicide_df %>%
  mutate(
    victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White")
  ) %>% 
    nest(data = -city_state) %>% 
    mutate(
      models = map(.x = data, ~ glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = .x, family =   binomial())),
      results = map(models, broom::tidy)
    ) %>% 
    select(city_state, results) %>% 
    unnest(results) %>% 
    mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, term, OR, starts_with("CI"))
```

``` r
model_results_df %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_raceBlack") %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_lower, ymax = CI_upper)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

None of the 47 states show significantly higher odds of homicide among
Black victims than White victims. Black victims have significantly lower
odds of homicide than White victims in many states including Boston,
Omaha, Oakland, etc.

## Problem 2

``` r
birthweight_df = 
  read.csv("data/birthweight.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>% 
  select(bwt,bhead, babysex, blength, fincome, gaweeks, malform, smoken, wtgain)
```

The variables that I put into the regression model are the factors that
I think could affect the birthweight, including baby’s sex, baby’s head
circumference at birth, baby’s length at birth, family monthly income
(in hundreds, rounded), gestational age, average number of cigarettes
smoked per day during pregnancy, mother’s weight gain during pregnancy.

Plot of model residuals against fitted values

``` r
lm_1 = lm(bwt ~ babysex + bhead + blength + fincome + gaweeks + smoken + wtgain, data = birthweight_df)

birthweight_df %>% 
  add_predictions(lm_1) %>%
  add_residuals(lm_1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .3)
```

Compare the model with the other two using cross-validation

``` r
cv_df = 
  crossv_mc(birthweight_df, 100) %>% 
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble)
  )

cv_df = 
  cv_df %>% 
  mutate(
    mod_1 = map(.x = train, ~lm(bwt ~ babysex + bhead + blength + fincome + gaweeks + smoken + wtgain, data = .x)),
    mod_2 = map(.x = train, ~ lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)),
    mod_3 = map(.x = train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead * blength * babysex, data = .x))
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    rmse_mod_1 = map2_dbl(.x = mod_1, .y = test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_mod_2 = map2_dbl(.x = mod_2, .y = test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_mod_3 = map2_dbl(.x = mod_3, .y = test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y))
  )

cv_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model",
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_"
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) +
  geom_violin()
```

![](p8105_hw6_ym2770_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

Compute rmse means for each model:

``` r
cv_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model",
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_"
  ) %>% 
  group_by(model) %>% 
  summarize(avg_rmse = mean(rmse))
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 2
    ##   model avg_rmse
    ##   <chr>    <dbl>
    ## 1 mod_1     283.
    ## 2 mod_2     334.
    ## 3 mod_3     291.

Conclusion: The model I built has the smallest rmse compared with the
other two and thus can predict birthweight better.
