## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read.csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ 1
    )
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
    city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>% 
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
```

Start with one city

``` r
baltimore_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, 
    data = baltimore_df,
    family = binomial()) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(term, OR, starts_with("CI")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term              |    OR | CI\_lower | CI\_upper |
| :---------------- | ----: | --------: | --------: |
| (Intercept)       | 1.363 |     0.975 |     1.907 |
| victim\_age       | 0.993 |     0.987 |     1.000 |
| victim\_raceWhite | 2.320 |     1.648 |     3.268 |
| victim\_sexMale   | 0.426 |     0.325 |     0.558 |

Try this across cities.

``` r
model_results_df = 
  homicide_df %>%
  mutate(
    victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White")
  ) %>% 
    nest(data = -city_state) %>% 
    mutate(
      models = map(.x = data, ~ glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = .x, family =   binomial())),
      results = map(models, broom::tidy)
    ) %>% 
    select(city_state, results) %>% 
    unnest(results) %>% 
    mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, term, OR, starts_with("CI"))
```

``` r
model_results_df %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_raceBlack") %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_lower, ymax = CI_upper)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

None of the 47 states show significantly higher odds of homicide among
Black victims than White victims. Black victims have significantly lower
odds of homicide than White victims in several states including Boston,
Omaha, Oakland, etc.
