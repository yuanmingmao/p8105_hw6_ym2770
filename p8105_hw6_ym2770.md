## Problem 1

The raw data collect information on more than 52,000 criminal homicides
over the past decade in 50 of the largest American cities. The data
included the location of the killing, whether an arrest was made and, in
most cases, basic demographic information about each victim.

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read.csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ 1
    )
  ) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>% 
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
```
